## Introduction

The aim of this project is to show case how can one use strategy pattern to describe a bunch of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable. 

In simple words, it allows us to change the algorithm independently without changing the client using it.


## Out Of Scope

Since the main idea is to implement strategy method pattern in code, tests are out of scope of this project. 

## Explanation Strategy Pattern

**Background**

There are two use cases in programming which are not so easy to solve when applied to a number of classes/large code base. They are:

* multiple if/else for a logic: TODO: Describe this part!

* Inheritance cases in which not all methods must be implemented in child classes: TODO: Describe this part!

**Reasons for using strategy method pattern:**
- Problem with inheritance: TODO: Describe it with a general scenario. Use the example of Ducks but in a general way.
- strategy pattern uses composition.

The **scenario used in this project** is as follows:

- TODO: Describe scenario!
- TODO: Create a rough UML diagram and adapt to the simulation solution implemented in the code.

**Solution:**

- TODO: describe solution with the help of code.

## Explanation Other Important Points

Using strategy pattern has the following advantages:

- One can isolate the implementation details of an algorithm from the code that uses it.
- We can swap the algorithms used inside an object at runtime.
- By using this design pattern, we replace inheritance with composition.
- Open/Closed principle of SOLID is upheld i.e. we can introduce new strategies without having to change the context.

## Technologies Used

- Java 11

## Prerequisities

None

## Commands

- TODO: Describe this part.
