- Strategy pattern can be seen as another name for dependency injection.

- We have an input configuration as follows:
 ** We have a distribution of a number of variables.
 ** We sample these distributions.
 ** And some computation is done on them.
 ** In our example, we will flip the coin randomly and then print the results in some way.
